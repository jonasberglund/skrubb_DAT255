#Events GUI Test
##Steps
1. Start the application, a view showing news from Facebook should now show up.
2. Tap the H-icon in the upper left corner to show a menu. (Or slide it out from the left side)
3. Click on "Events"
4. Let the page load, if an error message, "Anslut till internet...", shows up, it is probably a connection error.
5. If the view shows up, you should see a list of all future events. 
6. If the screen does not holds all the contents, you should be able to scroll.
7. Try to click on a event. The list item should now expand and show some more details about the event, such as a descrition, where it is and when. Tapping the same event again shoud close the expansion.
8. By tapping your "back"-button you should see the "News" view (the view that showed up when you started the application or the view you last visited).
9. By tapping "back" from the "News" view, your home screen should load.

If all steps above succeed, this test has succeeded!
