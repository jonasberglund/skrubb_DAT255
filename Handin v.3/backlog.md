##New User Stories:
- As a user, I would like to be able to report faulty equipment and other things not working
properly in Chalmers facilities.

##Removed User Stories:
- As a user, I would like to see an option to vote in polls concerning the section.

**Why:** It's not a very necessary feature, and would be hard to realize.  

We also were thinking about putting some VÃ¤sttrafik-information in the app, but also this feature
is removed.
